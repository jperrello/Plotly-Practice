This is a series of programs that I have been writing
this past week in order to get more experience in 
Plotly.js.

There are still issues I have to resolve with this code,
particlarily with the bar graph losing its color upon a 
click event. But in the meantime this is the work I have
completed.

Here you will find various files including html, css, 
javascript, and csv. The html file includes all the 
necessary components such as buttons and inclusion of the 
current version of plotly in order to have the charts be
displayed on a webpage. The css file helps format the graphs 
to be centered on the webpage. And lastly the javascript file
includes all of the scripts that are necessary to create the
charts.
